Hörmann Supramatic garage door opener plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

Hörmann and Supramatic are trademarks owned by [Hörmann KG Verkaufsgesellschaft](https://www.hoermann.com/).

This plugin was developed for a [Hörmann Supramatic](https://www.hormann.co.uk/home-owners-and-renovators/operators/garage-door-operators/) garage door opener connected via a UAP1 (Universal Adapter Print) and a [Moxa ioLogik E1214](https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-edge-connectivity/controllers-and-ios/universal-controllers-and-i-os/iologik-e1200-series/iologik-e1214) remote Ethernet I/O server.

## Installation

1. Connect and configure the UAP1 and ioLogik E1214 (see wiring and configuration guide below).
1. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-garagedoor-iologik`
1. Edit `config.json` and add a Garagedoor-ioLogik accessory for each garage door to be controlled (see example below).
1. Run [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

### Wiring

The Supramatic provides 24V DC power to the ioLogik E1214 via the UAP1. The **power terminal block** on the top panel of the ioLogik E1214 should be connected to the main terminal block in the UAP1 as follows:

| ioLogik E1214 | UAP1    | Description                         |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------      |
| V+            | 5 (24V) | Power supply for ioLogik E1214      |
| V-            | 20 (0V) | Power supply for ioLogik E1214      |
| GND           |         | Ground not connected to UAP1        |

The ioLogik E1214 main **I/O channels terminal block** is wired to the UAP1 as follows:

| ioLogik E1214 | UAP1    | Description                         |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------      |
| COM           | 5 (24V) | Common for DI channels              |
| DI0           | K01.8   | DI-00 input: Door open              |
| DI1           | K02.8   | DI-01 input: Door closed            |
| DI2           | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| DI3           | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| DI4           | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| DI5           | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| GND           | 20 (0V) | Ground for DI channels              |
| R0_NO         | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| R0_C          | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| R1_NO         | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| R1_C          | -       | *(not connected)*                   |
| R2_NO         | 15 (S2) | DO-02 relay output: Go open         |
| R2_C          | 20 (0V) | DO-02 relay common: Go open         |
| R3_NO         | 23 (S3) | DO-02 relay output: Go partial open |
| R3_C          | 20 (0V) | DO-02 relay common: Go partial open |
| R4_NO         | 17 (S4) | DO-02 relay output: Go close        |
| R4_C          | 20 (0V) | DO-02 relay common: Go close        |
| R5_NO         | 10 (S5) | DO-02 relay output: Toggle light    |
| R5_C          | 20 (0V) | DO-02 relay common: Toggle light    |

The DI channels are connected to the UAP1 relays as dry contacts. The DO channels connect the UAP1 inputs to 0V when the relays are activated.

### ioLogik Configuration

The ioLogik E1214 must be running firmware version 2.5 or later to support RESTful API. Ensure that the **Enable Resful API** option is enabled.

The **DI channels** should be configured as follows:

| DI Channel | Mode | Filter | Alias of Channel | Alias of OFF Status | Alias of ON Status |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| DI-00      | DI   | 100ms  | Door is open     | Not open            | Open               |
| DI-01      | DI   | 100ms  | Door is closed   | Not closed          | Closed             |
| DI-02      | DI   | 100ms  | ~~DI~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |
| DI-03      | DI   | 100ms  | ~~DI~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |
| DI-04      | DI   | 100ms  | ~~DI~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |
| DI-05      | DI   | 100ms  | ~~DI~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |

The **DO channels** should be configured as follows:

| DO Channel | Mode         | OFF Width | ON Width | Pulse Count | Alias of Channel | Alias of OFF Status | Alias of ON Status |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| DO-00      | DO           |           |          |             | ~~DO~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |
| DO-01      | DO           |           |          |             | ~~DO~~           | ~~OFF~~             | ~~ON~~             |
| DO-02      | Pulse Output | 1 (1.5s)  | 1 (1.5s) | 1           | Open             | Idle                | Go open            |
| DO-03      | Pulse Output | 1 (1.5s)  | 1 (1.5s) | 1           | Partial open     | Idle                | Go partial open    |
| DO-04      | Pulse Output | 1 (1.5s)  | 1 (1.5s) | 1           | Close            | Idle                | Go close           |
| DO-05      | Pulse Output | 1 (1.5s)  | 1 (1.5s) | 1           | Light            | Idle                | Toggle light       |

### Example `config.json`
```JSON
{
    "accessories":
    [{
        "accessory":    "Garagedoor-ioLogik",
        "name":         "Bunker Door",
        "host":         "iologik-e1214"
    }]
}
```
Multiple accessories can be added to control different garage doors. They must be each given a unique name.

The `host` specifies how to reach the ioLogik E1214.

## Notes

The following (non-default) timings are hardcoded in the plugin:

| MENU 2 | Switch-off delay | Description                                 |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 5      | 5 minutes        | Illumination during and after door movement |
| 9      | 15 minutes       | Switched via radio/external button          |
